        <p class="bodyText">Welcome to Coding Cats! This website was created by the leaders of the Westminster Coding
            Club to showcase the projects made within our organization. Last year, the Westminster Coding Club focused
            on
            teaching its members how to code by making games in Processing. After having amassed a score of these
            projects, we decided to create a website to house all of them. You can play any number of games, download
            their source code, and learn from them.</p>

        <p class="bodyText">The coding club is an outlet for people at <a
                href="https://www.westminster.net/">Westminster</a>, our high school, to display any coding projects
            they
            are proud of, or a resource to further develop projects, peer to peer. Members can put their projects on our
            website or they can just come to our club asking for help. We hope to leave the infrastructure behind for a
            great continuation of the club after we leave.</p>
